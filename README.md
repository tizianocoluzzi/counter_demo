## Description
This project has been created with the goal of providing a practical foundation for understanding the dynamics of client-server communication in Java. The project focuses on using basic Java knowledge without the use of external frameworks, offering a practical application to enhance Java programming skills.

## Project Contents
The project consists of two main components: the server and the client.

### Server
The server is responsible for handling requests from clients and interacting with the database. Server goals include:
- Accepting connections from clients on a specific port.
- Handling client requests and sending appropriate responses.

### Client
The client is a simple application that connects to the server to send requests and receive responses. Client goals include:
- Establishing a connection with the server at a specific IP address and port.
- Sending requests to the server and handling received responses.

2. **Compiling and Running the Server:**
   - Navigate to the server directory (`cd server`).
   - Compile the server using `javac Server.java`.
   - Run the server using `java Server`.

3. **Compiling and Running the Client:**
   - Navigate to the client directory (`cd client`).
   - Compile the client using `javac Main.java`.
   - Run the client using `java Client`.

We welcome contributions and improvements. Feel free to open issues and pull requests to suggest new features, fix bugs, or improve documentation.
